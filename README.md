# Training a Neural Network to play Coders Strike Back #

Here I will describe how I trained a neural network to play the game [Coders Strike Back](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back).  This is a racing game where one of your two bots must finish the race course before the opposing bots.  Here you can see a clip of my bot in action.

At each time step you can adjust the direction and thrust of your bot.  Because of the collisions and the weird physics, it is not easy to just code a simple navigation algorithm for your bot.  All the good players simulate the physics of the course exactly.  Then most of them use some sort of genetic (or Monte Carlo, simulated annealing) algorithm to search for a near optimal policy, using a hand-crafted evaluation function.  The idea is that on each turn, they simulate random trajectories, score how they do in the simulation, modify the best ones slightly, and simulate thoseâ€”repeating until the time limit runs out.  (See [Magus' great tutorial](http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb_en.html) for instructions on how to set up a simulator and genetic algorithm for Coders Strike Back.)

However, especially if programming in Python, it is quite computationally expensive to run a lot of simulations, so the final result of the genetic algorithm is hit or miss.  If one started with a good random starting solution, then one is more likely to have a good solution in the end.  One way to improve this uncertainty is to *train* the algorithm to *remember* good moves.  This can be done via a *neural network*.

1. Simulate the game play environment.
2. Construct a genetic algorithm which can find the best(-ish) move.
3. Use data from running that algorithm many times to develop a set of training data.
4. Train a neural network with that training data to recognize the best moves.
5. Use that neural network policy alone, or better yet, use that neural network policy as a starting point for the genetic algorithm.
6. Repeat steps 3-6 to continuously improve the neural network policy until it stops improving.

Doing this significantly improved the performance of my bot from just using genetic algorithm alone.

## Details ##

**(I will update this section with more details later.)**  
Some quick points:
- I just used a standard feed-forward neural network with dense layers.
- I trained the network with TensorFlow on Python, but ran it in the competition environment using custom built neural network code written in Python/NumPy.  (See [here](https://github.com/jasonrute/Neural-Network) for the NN code.)
- I only trained a racing policy.  There was no blocking, collision avoidance, or anything else involving iterations with the other racing bots (even the other one on the same team).  (However, I did add all those things to the genetic algorithm used in the actual game play.)
- The inputs for the neural network were the relative positions of the next two checkpoints.
- The outputs were the new acceleration and the relative change in angle.
- Agada used deep Q-learning and got better results.  I think the big difference is that deep Q-learning (and other forms of reinforcement learning) allows the neural network to learn its own evaluation function, were I relied on a custom (and likely imperfect) evaluation function.

## Code ##
Since it is a competition, I am not going to give out my code.  

However, you can find an [implementation of a neural network](https://github.com/jasonrute/Neural-Network) written in Python/Numpy that can run inside CodinGames.  It doesn't take up too many lines of code (especially if you remove all the lines related to training it, which you don't need to do inside the competition code.)

When saving the neural network weights, you can use float16 to save space.  Then to store them in your competition code (which has a limit on the file size) do the following:
- convert to bytes with pickle.dumps
- compress with zlib.compress
- convert to ASCII with b64.encode
- paste that ASCII string into the code
- decode with `pickle.loads(zlib.decompress(b64.b64decode(string_repr_of_object)))`
